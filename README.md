# Future_datathon<br>
My Idea behind Future Datathon (offline Round).<br>
1)Used the transaction date and extracted the day,month and year.<br>
2)extracted the census data(2011) of the given cities and clubbed it with initial data.<br>
3)Using Kmeans clustering,I made 8 optimal clusters.<br>
4)Then i used user product recommendation engine for recommending the products in every cluster.<br>

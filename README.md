# Future_datathon
My Idea behind Future Datathon (offline Round).
1)Used the transaction date and extracted the day,month and year.
2)extracted the census data(2011) of the given cities and clubbed it with initial data.
3)Using Kmeans clustering,I 8 optimal clusters.
4)Then i used user product recommendation engine for recommending the products in every cluster.
